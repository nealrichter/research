Intelligent algorithms are, in many cases, practical alternative techniques for tackling and solving a variety of challenging engineering problems. For example, fuzzy control techniques can be used to construct nonlinear controllers via the use of heuristic information when information on the physical system is limited. Such heuristic information may come, for instance, from an operator who has acted as a “human-in-the-loop” controller for the process. This course investigates several concepts and techniques commonly referred to as intelligent algorithms; discusses the underlying theory of these methodologies when appropriate; and takes an engineering perspective and approach to the design, analysis, evaluation, and implementation of Intelligent Systems. Fuzzy systems, genetic algorithms, particle swarm and ant colony optimization techniques, and neural networks are the primary concepts discussed in this course, and several engineering applications are presented along the way. Expert (rule-based) systems are also discussed within the context of fuzzy systems. An intelligent algorithms research paper must be selected from the existing literature, implemented by the student, and presented as a final project.  Prerequisite(s): Student familiarity of system-theoretic concepts is desirable.

Students will be introduced to core concurrent programming principles, along with the specific hardware and software considerations of these frameworks. In addition, students will learn canonical algorithms used to perform high-precision mathematics and data transformations. Class time will be split between lectures and hands-on exercises. There will be two individual projects in both CUDA and OpenCL programming, which will allow students to independently choose demonstrable goals, develop software to achieve those goals, and present the results of their efforts.

- **Schedule:** Spring 2026: 01/20/2026 - 05/05/2026
- **Instructor:** TBD
- **Description:**
Traditionally, logic is the study of correct reasoning. In the last few decades, logic has become increasingly important to knowledge representation — a subfield of artificial intelligence concerned with developing representations of the world (often called ontologies) that aid computers in understanding and making sense of data. This course will promote both a theoretical and practical understanding of logic as a stepping stone for working in contemporary knowledge representation. We will begin with a review of categorical, propositional, and predicate logic. We will then survey modal logics, which include systems that represent necessity and probability, as well as other systems that represent time, and moral notions such as obligation and permissibility. The second half of the course will then introduce the semantic web and ontology engineering. Students will explore the top-level ontology Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and gain familiarity using mereological and temporal relations. In addition, students will create ontologies in the web ontology language (OWL2) and use the language SPARQL to query knowledge graphs. Students will have the option of writing either a research paper or creating an ontology in OWL with slides as part of a final project.

This course explores computer science topics that lie at the intersection of data science and social psychology. Topics include crowdsourcing, social media, social network analysis, games, gamification, ubiquitous computing, and computersupported cooperative work. Laboratory exercises will involve hands-on data collection and analysis to include Mechanical Turk and require programming in R or Python depending on student preference/proficiency.

- **Schedule:** Spring 2026: 01/20/2026 - 05/05/2026
- **Instructor:** TBD
- **Description:**
This is a foundational course in Artificial Intelligence. Although we hear a lot about machine learning, artificial intelligence is a much broader field with many different aspects. In this course, we focus on three of those aspects: reasoning, optimization, and pattern recognition. Traditionally, the first was covered under “Symbolic AI” or “Good Old Fashioned AI” and the latter two were covered under “Numeric AI” (or more specifically, “Connectionist AI” or “Machine Learning”). However, despite the many successes of machine learning algorithms, practitioners are increasingly realizing that complicated AI systems need algorithms from all three aspects. This approach falls under the ironic heading “Hybrid AI”. In this course, the foundational algorithms of AI are presented in an integrated fashion emphasizing Hybrid AI. The topics covered include state space search, local search, example based learning, model evaluation, adversarial search, constraint satisfaction problems, logic and reasoning, expert systems, rule based ML, Bayesian networks, planning, reinforcement learning, regression, logistic regression, and artificial neural networks (multi-layer perceptrons). The assignments weigh conceptual (assessments) and practical (implementations) understanding equally. EN.605.621 Foundations of Algorithms. A working knowledge of Python programming is assumed as all assignments are completed in Python.

The dominant paradigm in contemporary NLP uses supervised machine learning to train models based on either probability theory or deep neural networks. Both formalisms will be covered. A practical approach is emphasized in the course, and students will write programs and use open source toolkits to solve a variety of problems. Course prerequisite(s): There are no formal prerequisite courses, although having taken any of EN.605.649 Introduction to Machine Learning, EN.605.744 Information Retrieval, or EN.605.645 Artificial Intelligence is helpful. Course note(s): A working knowledge of Python is assumed. While some of the assigned exercises can be done in any programming language, we will sometimes provide example code in Python, and many of the labs are best solved in Python.Course note(s):  A working knowledge of Python is assumed.

Organizations today are generating massive amounts of data that are too large and too unwieldy to fit in relational databases. Therefore, organizations and enterprises are turning to massively parallel computing solutions such as Hadoop for help. The Apache Hadoop platform, with Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and MapReduce (M/R) framework at its core, allows for distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using the map and reduce programming model. It is designed to scale up from a single server to thousands of machines, offering local computation and storage. The Hadoop ecosystem is sizable in nature and includes many subprojects such as Hive and Pig for big data analytics, HBase for real-time access to big data, Zookeeper for distributed transaction process management, and Oozie for workflow. This course breaks down the walls of complexity of distributed processing of big data by providing a practical approach to developing applications on top of the Hadoop platform. By completing this course, students will gain an in-depth understanding of how MapReduce and Distributed File Systems work. In addition, they will be able to author Hadoop-based MapReduce applications in Java and also leverage Hadoop subprojects to build powerful data processing applications.

Additionally, the course aims to extend the attention idea into the 2D spatial domain for image datasets, investigate how convolution can be generalized using self-attention within the encoder-decoder meta architecture, analyze how this generic architecture is almost the same in image as in text and NLP, which makes transformers a generic function approximator, and discuss the channel and spatial attention, local vs. global attention among other topics. Furthermore, we will also study different neural architectures that are designed for several fundamental tasks in computer vision, namely, classification, object detection, semantic and instance segmentation. In particular, vision transformer, pyramid vision transformer, shifted window transformer (Swin), Detection Transformer (DETR), segmentation transformer (SETR), and many others will be explored.
