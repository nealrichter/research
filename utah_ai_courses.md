This seminar course exposes students to a wide variety of topics in the vast area of data science. These will range from cutting edge research results and open problems to how these techniques transfer to pressing challenges in industry or research labs dependent on these techniques. Data Science, and seminar talks, will include a wide-array of topics in machine learning, data management, data visualization, mathematics of data, data mining, fairness and trustworthiness of algorithms, and algorithmic challenges in big data. Perspectives will include both theoretical developments to challenges to transferring in practice, and all parts in between. The talks will vary significantly in topic, but should mostly be accessible to a graduate student or junior-level undergrad in a data science related area. Students at all levels will get to engage with experts in data science, discover their interests within this space, and explore potential directions and partners for research collaborations.

- **Schedule:** MoWeFr 09:40AM-10:30AM
- **Instructor:** TBD
- **Description:**
During their last two semesters, senior Data Science students form teams to develop significant software projects. This class is the first semester in the sequence. Seniors will work on team formation, project identification, project planning (including UI design, software architecture, testing methods, scheduling, etc.), and completion of a system prototype. This course will provide teams with time and guidance to effectively plan their projects, as well as emphasizing the written and oral communications necessary to succeed in industry. Projects formed in this course must be completed during the following semester in DS 4850. Students should be graduating during the following semester.

- **Schedule:** TuTh 03:40PM-05:00PM
- **Instructor:** TBD
- **Description:**
The course begins by bootstrapping student's coding skills in the programming language Python, followed by a review of the relevant concepts from statistics. After that, we will move through a series of data science methods using real-life, project-based, lectures and computer labs. The major goals of this course are to learn how to use tools for acquiring, cleaning, analyzing, exploring, and visualizing data; making data-driven inferences and decisions; and effectively communicating results. These will be accomplished through an in-depth sequence of topics which will introduce students to the following data preparation and analysis methods: Acquiring data through web-scraping and data APIs, Cleaning and reshaping messy datasets using methods such as data frames, regular expressions or dedicated tools, Exploratory data analysis and visualization, Hypothesis testing, Clustering and classification, Rating and ranking, Recommendations, Network analysis, Regression and statistical inference, Natural language processing, Working with large data: databases, parallel programming. A major component of this course will be learning how to use python-based programming tools to apply these methods to real-life datasets. Students should have a basic-level of programming experience before taking this course.
